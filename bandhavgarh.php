                        <p class="mt-40">
                            The state of Rewa owes its origins to the foundation of a state dating to 1234 by Vyaghra
                            Dev, a descendant of the Vaghelas of Gujarat. He married the daughter of the Raja of
                            Ratanpur, bringing Bandhogarh (now known as Bandhavgarh) into the family as her dowry. The
                            legendary fortress of Bandhogarh fell into Mughal hands in 1597, almost by accident. At the
                            death of Maharaja Virbhadra Rao in 1593, his minor son succeeded and was sent to Delhi for
                            his own safety, the emperor took advantage of his absence to send one of his loyal nobles as
                            temporary governor. Once he had taken control of the fort, the Maharaja’s nobles and
                            officials were expelled and the fort annexed by the Mughals. On his return to his remaining
                            domains, H.H. Maharaja Vikramaditya was forced to establish a new capital at Rewa, from
                            whence the state took its name.

                            <strong>Landscape of the Bandavgarh National Park:</strong>
                            <br>
                            The "jungle" is mostly sparse and dry undergrowth with large areas of woodland. The Park is
                            set around the "castle" - a huge outcrop of rock with a massive plateau top. The whole area
                            is very dry and dusty. Covering 450 sq km, Bandhavgarh is situated in Umaria district of
                            Madhya Pradesh among the outlying hills of the Vindhya range. At the center of park is
                            Bandhavgarh hill rising 811 meters above MSL. The lowest point in the park is at Tala (440
                            meter above MSL). Bandhavgarh is densely populated with other species. Bandhavgarh is sided
                            with great cliffs and eroded rocks and on its highest point stands "Bandhavgarh fort"
                            estimated to be some 2,000 years old. Around the fort are numerous caves containing shrines
                            and ancients Sanskrit inscription.
                            <br><br>
                            Though small in size, yet it is the national park known for its highest tiger population.
                            The former hunting reserve of the royal family of Rewa; Bandhavgarh was declared a National
                            Park in 1968 and further extended to the adjoining Sal Forests in 1986. The thick forest and
                            Vindhyan Mountains surround Bandhavgarh National Park. Its plains have a number of grass and
                            reed covered wetlands dominated by the Kingfishers and Egrets. The Bandhavgarh National
                            Park, covering an area of 542.40-sq-kms, Bandhavgarh Wildlife Sanctuary has 60 resident
                            tigers and is noted for its tiger population. The fine trees of Sal cover half of the
                            Bandhavgarh National Park while the higher hills consist of the mixed forests. The wide
                            stretches of bamboo and grasslands cover the entire northern region. The entire national
                            park is encompassed by 32 wooded hills.

                            vegetation like Sali, Saj, Saja, Dhobin, etc. are found in these higher lands. Stretches of

                            Archaeological Remains. You can also visit Khajuraho (230 km) for a complete but welcome
                            change. But, if you have a hunger for more wildlife then you may visit Kanha Wildlife
                            Sanctuary (250 km).

                            <strong>Climate:</strong>
                            <br>
                            Bandhavgarh experiences climatic conditions that vary to opposite extremes. In winters, the
                            bitter cold forces the visitors to put on multiple layers as protection against the biting
                            cold. Early morning rides can be in temperatures that dip about four, once you take the wind
                            chill factor into consideration. In the summers, it changes drastically to the opposite. It
                            now fee is uncomfortable to even sometimes put on the cotton t-shirt. The temperature in the
                            winters varies from 4 to 20°C between November and February. In the summers, the
                            temperatures move to the other extreme and can go up to 48 degrees centigrade. Towards late
                            summer, it is also advisable to carry some protection, for yourself and for your camaras,
                            from rain. Bandhavgarh has an average annual rainfall of 1200 mm. The rains here give very
                            little prior warning and it is preferable to be prepared for your own protection, as well as
                            for your equipment. These rains, however, bring good respite from the blistering heat. A
                            single shower can make temperatures fall from 45°C to 30°C.
